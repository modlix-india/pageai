Since these are all react js components all will be finally rendered into html. Each of these components are build using multiple layers of html tags. So some of these components will definition of sub components. The page json object structure is as follows.

```
{
    "name": "<Page Name>",
    "properties": {
        "title" : {
            "name": {

    properties : 

        Allowed values for "Append Value" are "true", "false" and "prepend". If "true" is given, the title will be appended to the title specified in application definition. If "false" is given, the title will be replaced with the new title. If "prepend" is given, the title will be prepended to the title specified in application definition. 
        
        Allowed SEO properties are "description", "keywords", "robots", "charset", "author", "applicationName", "generator". The value for these properties are the value of the respective meta tag. 
        
        classes :

            When using custom animations or complex styles used they can be specified in classes. The key for the class should be unique. The value for the key is an object with the following properties. "selector" is the css selector or animation name. "style" is the css style or animation properties. "key" is the unique key like short UUID.

        onLoadEvent :
        
            The onLoadEvent is the event function that is triggered when the page is loaded. The key is the key of the event function in the eventFunctions property of the page.


    rootComponent :

        The component key is the key of the component which is the root component of the page. The root component is the parent component of all the components in the page. Like any HTML dom structure this is also a tree structure with the root component as the parent of all the components. A component cannot be a child of more than one parent component.

    componentDefinition :

        Each component has a key which is unique. The key is used to refer the component in the children property of the parent component. The name is the label of the component which will be displayed in the editor. The type is the type. A detailed description of each component is given below. The properties are the properties of the component. The value of the property is the value of the property. If the property is an array type, the value is an array of values. The children property is an object with the key as the key of the child component and the value as true. If the component has no children, the children property is not present. Each component's html is rendered based on the properties and style properties specified. 

            Display Order (displayOrder) :

                The display order is the order in which the components are displayed. The order is a number. The components are displayed in the increasing order of the display order. If the display order is not specified, the components are displayed in the sorted order of the key. 

            Properties (properties) :

                Properties for each type of component are different and a detailed list of properties for each component is specified in the end of this document.

                Many editable components like text box, text area, dropdown has a special property called validation. It is an array type property. The structure for array type property is shown above.

                The validation property is an array of objects. Each object has a type and a message. The type is the type of validation. The allowed types are "MANDATORY", "REGEX", "STRING_LENGTH", "BOOLEAN_CONDITION", "SCHEMA_TYPE", "EMAIL", "NUMBER_VALUE", "FILE_SIZE". The message is the message to be displayed when the validation fails. The message is a property. The validation is triggered. Not all types are allowed for all components. The allowed types for each component are specified in the detailed description of the component. 

                    MANDATORY - if the type is mandatory it requires only the message property. The message is the message to be displayed when the field is mandatory and not filled.

                    REGEX - if the type is regex it requires the message and the regex property. The pattern property is the regular expression to be matched, it is of type string. The message is the message to be displayed when the field does not match the regular expression. Also, ignoreCase property is used to ignore the case of the regular expression, default value is false.

                    STRING_LENGTH - if the type is string length it requires the message, minLength and maxLength properties. The minLength is the minimum length of the string, it is of type number. The maxLength is the maximum length of the string, it is of type number. The message is the message to be displayed when the length of the string is not in the range.

                    BOOLEAN_CONDITION - if the type is boolean condition it requires the message and the condition property. The condition is the condition to be checked, it is of type boolean, generally an expression is used to validate a condition. The message is the message to be displayed when the condition is false.

                    SCHEMA_TYPE - if the type is schema type it requires the message and the schema property. The schema is the schema to be validated, it is of type object. It is json schema. The message is the message to be displayed when the schema is not validated.

                    EMAIL - if the type is email it requires the message property. The message is the message to be displayed when the email is not valid.
                    
                    NUMBER_VALUE - if the type is number value it requires the message, minValue and maxValue properties. The minValue is the minimum value of the number, it is of type number. The maxValue is the maximum value of the number, it is of type number. The message is the message to be displayed when the number is not in the range. If the minValue and maxValue is not specified, the number is checked for being a number.

                    FILE_SIZE - if the type is file size it requires the message, minSize and maxSize properties. The minSize is the minimum size of the file, it is of type number. The maxSize is the maximum size of the file, it is of type number. The message is the message to be displayed when the file size is not in the range. The file size is in bytes.

                    Example for validation property with only MANDATORY validation : 
                    ```
                        {
                            "58xtKrpsWeNgL1YwhtP6e0": {
                                "key": "58xtKrpsWeNgL1YwhtP6e0",
                                "order": 1,
                                "property": {
                                "value": { 
                                    "type" : { "value": "MANDATORY" },
                                    "message": { "value": "Name cannot be empty" } }
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    ```

                    Example for validation property with MANDATORY and STRING_LENGTH validation :
                    ```
                        {
                            "58xtKrpsWeNgL1YwhtP6e0": {
                                "key": "58xtKrpsWeNgL1YwhtP6e0",
                                "order": 1,
                                "property": {
                                "value": { 
                                    "type" : { "value": "MANDATORY" },
                                    "message": { "value": "Name cannot be empty" } }
                                }
                            },
                            "68xtKrpsWeNgL1YwhtP6e1": {
                                "key": "68xtKrpsWeNgL1YwhtP6e1",
                                "order": 2,
                                "property": {
                                "value": { 
                                    "type" : { "value": "STRING_LENGTH" },
                                    "message": { "value": "Name should be atleast 3 characters" } 
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    ```

            Style Properties (styleProperties) :

                The style properties are the css properties of the component. The key for the style property is unique. The value is an object with resolutions as the key and the value is an object with css properties. The resolutions can be "ALL", "WIDE_SCREEN", "DESKTOP_SCREEN", "TABLET_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN", "TABLET_POTRAIT_SCREEN", "MOBILE_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN", "MOBILE_POTRAIT_SCREEN", "DESKTOP_SCREEN_ONLY", "TABLET_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN_ONLY", "TABLET_POTRAIT_SCREEN_ONLY", "MOBILE_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN_ONLY", "MOBILE_POTRAIT_SCREEN_ONLY", "DESKTOP_SCREEN_SMALL", "TABLET_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN_SMALL", "TABLET_POTRAIT_SCREEN_SMALL", "MOBILE_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN_SMALL". The order of the resolutions is as follows. The resolutions are in decreasing order of width. 
            
                WIDE_SCREEN styles are applied only when the screen is width is 1281px or more. DESKTOP_SCREEN styles are applied only when the screen is width is 1025px or more. DESKTOP_SCREEN_ONLY styles are applied only when the screen is width is between 1025px and 1280px. DESKTOP_SCREEN_SMALL styles are applied only when the screen is width is 1280px or less. TABLET_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN_ONLY styles are applied only when the screen is width is between 961px and 1024px. TABLET_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN_SMALL styles are applied only when the screen is width is 1024px or less. TABLET_POTRAIT_SCREEN_ONLY styles are applied only when the screen is width is between 641px and 960px. TABLET_POTRAIT_SCREEN_SMALL styles are applied only when the screen is width is 960px or less. MOBILE_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN_ONLY styles are applied only when the screen is width is between 481px and 640px. MOBILE_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN_SMALL styles are applied only when the screen is width is 640px or less. MOBILE_POTRAIT_SCREEN_ONLY styles are applied only when the screen is width is 480px or less. MOBILE_POTRAIT_SCREEN styles are applied only when the screen is width is 321px or more. TABLET_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN styles are applied only when the screen is width is 961px or more. TABLET_POTRAIT_SCREEN styles are applied only when the screen is width is 641px or more. MOBILE_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN styles are applied only when the screen is width is 481px or more. 
                
                The order of the resolutions is important. The styles are applied based on the order of the resolutions. The order of the resolutions is as follows - 	MOBILE_POTRAIT_SCREEN, MOBILE_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN, TABLET_POTRAIT_SCREEN, TABLET_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN, DESKTOP_SCREEN, WIDE_SCREEN, DESKTOP_SCREEN_SMALL, TABLET_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN_SMALL, TABLET_POTRAIT_SCREEN_SMALL, MOBILE_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN_SMALL, DESKTOP_SCREEN_ONLY, TABLET_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN_ONLY, TABLET_POTRAIT_SCREEN_ONLY, MOBILE_LANDSCAPE_SCREEN_ONLY, MOBILE_POTRAIT_SCREEN_ONLY.

                Some components have pseudo states defined for which the styles are applied. The pseudo states are "hover", "focus", "active", "visited", "disabled". The pseudo states are appended to the css property with a colon. For example, if the css property is "color" and the pseudo state is "hover", the css property will be "color:hover". The pseudo states are applied only when the component is in that state.

                Some components have sub-components and the styles are applied to the sub-components. The subcomponent name is appended to the css property with a hyphen. For example, if the css property is "color" and the subcomponent name is "text", the css property will be "text-color". The subcomponent styles are applied only to the sub-components. If the pseudo state has to be applied to the subcomponent, the pseudo state is appended to the css property with a colon.
