    8. Gallery component is not like any other gallery components. Usually gallery components will show a preview of the images and upon clicking an image it launches in to a mode that occupies the entire page like a popup to show the slide show of the images in it. For one to launch a Gallery they have to supply the list of images as part of data property and then use Grid and/or Image components to show the images. On click of any of these arranged images can trigger an event to set a store path to true which is bound in the binding path. For example "Page.showGallery" will be set to true on click of any image using eventFunctions. Also in that eventFunction one can set from which image the gallery should start to a different path that is bound to the bindingPath2 of the Gallery. If this is not available it will start from the first image provided in the data. It has options like fullscreen, magnifying and listing and other options.
