    2. ArrayRepeater is a component to repeat one child component multiple times. It is like a for loop in programming languages.

        It can have only one child component.

        It has the following binding paths.
            
            1. bindingPath - Array Repeater Binding Path of an array or an object. The array is repeated based on the length of the array or the number properties in an object. The array or object can be a store path or a static data using the default data property. If it is a store path, the value of the store path should be an array or an object. Since you can do operations on this array like re-organize, filter, delete, etc., it requires a binding path rather than a property. When an object is used, moving the children is not possible.

            2. bindingPath2 - When some data is dropped on the repeater, the data is stored in this path. If a dropDataPrefix is specified it is removed and then converted to the data type specified in dropDataType.

        It has no pseudo states.

        It has the following sub-components.
            1. repeaterProperties - It is just named as "repeaterProperties" but it is actually the child component which is the container for all the controls and the child component that needs repetition.
            2. repeatedComp - It is the container of the component of each child component.
            3. iconGrid - It is the container of the icons like add, remove, move.
            4. add - Add button to add a new repeated component.
            5. remove - Remove button to remove a repeated component.
            6. move - Move button to move a repeated component.

        It has the following properties.

            16. onDropData - Event to be triggered when data is dropped.
            17. filterCondition - Filter condition using "Data." to filter the array items. Eg: "Data.marks > 20" gives all the objects with marks greater than 20.
            18. layout - Following are the valid values for this property - "ROWLAYOUT", "ROWCOLUMNLAYOUT", "SINGLECOLUMNLAYOUT", "TWOCOLUMNSLAYOUT", "THREECOLUMNSLAYOUT", "FOURCOLUMNSLAYOUT", "FIVECOLUMNSLAYOUT".
